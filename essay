1. What topic in science or math do you currently find most interesting and why? When and how did you become aware of it? How have you explored it?

When I was in primary school, especially before the fifth grade, my Maths grade was very common. But my parents were expecting much more than just average. I could always feel their disappointment when I took the test papers home for parents’ signatures.
But then in the sixth grade, somehow, my Maths score improved a lot. In the final examination in the sixth grade, with excellent grade in Maths, I got the first place in the whole grade, winning ¥30,000 of scholarship in my life for the first time.
This was the first time when I found Maths to be useful.
When I was in middle school, I had to learn 7 to 9 subjects at the same time. In order to balance different subjects, Maths was no longer that important and gradually became a normal subject just like the others. Until the summer of the ninth grade, when I was attending Center for Talented Development in Northwestern University, one of my classmates developed an intriguing game, using an ingenious algorithm. I realized Maths’ unique charm to me.
After a busy year in IBDP curriculum, teachers told us to choose a subject and a specific topic for the upcoming Extended Essay. We were also told that relevant researches should be started as early as possible. I came to the Maths teacher almost immediately and told him that I want to choose Maths as the subject for the Extended Essay. However, he told me that among all the graduates of our high school over the past seven years, there was only one student who got A in Maths Extended Essay. Most students got C or D. Therefore, he suggested me to consider it in a more detailed way. When I ask my parents for advise, my mother suggested Chinese. Because most of students would choose Chinese. And the rate of getting A is much bigger if I choose Chinese. My father suggested Computer Science because a project would be very useful during the application of university.
This time, Maths is no longer important. At least in my parents’ eyes, Chinese and Computer Science are more useful.
But I’m still struggling. While I was collecting information for relevant ideas and proof procedure, I was amazed by Maths’ rigorous logic and elegant expressions. I want to be one of those people who could use the language of Maths to communicate. I know my parents’ suggestions are right. But this time whether Maths is important is up to me.

2. We know you lead a busy life, full of activities, many of which are required of you. Tell us about something you choose to do for enjoyment or relaxation.

3. Describe your personal "world"; for example, your family, school, community, city. How has your environment shaped your dreams and aspirations?

I was born in Suzhou, a city with more than 2,500 years of history. In my father’s description, he had no television, no air-conditioner, even no refrigerator in his childhood. But the river was clean. The sky was blue. In the summer, he would  play with his neighbors’ children. They would use wells as refrigerator to chill watermelons. At night, he would lay in a bamboo chair in the yard, looking at all the stars in the sky. His grandparents would tell the story about the Cowherd and the Weaving Maid.
In my childhood, there was computers, PADs and phones. My father gave me the best he could afford. But he still felt disappointment that he could not gave me the sky, the stars and the rivers.
For high school, I went to Shanghai, a metropolis that is developing rapidly in the past century. Here, I could feel the convenience that technology brought to us. And that in the next 10 years, technology would change people’s life in a more significant way. This time, I want to make up for his disappointment. The sky, the stars and the rivers. The things that he could not provide me with, I can find them.

 Describe a life challenge (of any nature, past or present)
 在IB学习中时间不够用，练出了在被子里盲打的技能

I chose International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme for the 11th and the 12th grade. I have two years to learn six subjects, a 4000-word essay and 150 hours of service, activity and creativity. Time was limited and there were always deadlines after one another. Everyone was trying to squeeze time from everywhere.
I study at a boarding school. Despite the rigorous curriculum we had to handle, there were also many rules to follow in the dorm. One that has been criticized a lot is lights out after 11 o’clock PM and everyone should be in bed. Teachers would come to each dorm from time to time to check if everyone is in bed. But time was never enough. So we had different ways to deal with the situation. One of my roommates would get up early if she could not finish her work on time. The other roommate would take her computer and cover her head under the blanket to avoid light. But both these methods are not very comfortable.
I preferred to sit on a chair instead of lying in a bed. But the light of the computer’s screen would draw the teachers. She could see the light from the window on the door from far, far away. Even we were whispering in the dorm, she could hear us talking from outside and walk in to warn us. Therefore, if I use computer on a chair, she could definitely see from outside and points would be deducted. However, I thought that if the light came from the screen, I only need to cut the light of the screen. But is it possible to abandon the screen when writing an essay?
I could type without looking at the keyboard but without screen would be quite a challenge. But due to all the deadlines I had, I had to give it a try.
By turning off the light of the screen, the dorm went black. My fingers were typing the keyboard but I could not see the screen. So I did not know am I typing the words right. When I turn on the light of the screen, I saw many red wavy underlines, indicating spelling mistakes. But I had to keep using this method because I did not have any other solutions.
After some time of practice, I could avoid the mistakes in English. But when writing Chinese paper, the problem could not be solved. Because Chinese has many words with the same pronunciation so there will be a list of different options to choose. But without the screen, I cannot see the options. Therefore, when “touch-typing” Chinese essays, I was typing an article that needs revision. But when I tried to learn about the input method, I could feel that the words I was looking for were normally the first ones on the option list. Even if I was typing an unusual word and it would not appear on the first or second on the option list, I could guess that maybe it is the fifth. When I turn on the screen, it was on the fifth. But most of the time, the Chinese article would seem rather strange.
By typing essays in a complete dark dorm, my efficiency improved a lot because I could spend more time. Even though life is still filled with deadlines, I managed to finish them on time.

 Describe an achievement that you are personally proud of
 组建国际部乒乓球队从去年的倒数第一到今年的第一名

For the first time in my life, I cried before a competition started……
I have been playing table tennis for over eight years all because of my own interest. When I entered high school in the tenth grade(high school is from the tenth grade to the twelfth grade in China), the first thing I asked my homeroom teacher was where were the table tennis room in the campus.
There was a competition in the school about two months after school started. I was very confident about the competition but I knew about the rules at the last second. I assumed that the competition was an individual competition. But in fact it was a team competition. Two male single players, two female single players and a mixed-double in the order of first single then double. In this way, our team has to win at least three games to win the other divisions. We decided in a short time that another boy who was quite strong and me would play mixed-double and the rest players would play single. Without proper training and preparation, I did not have the chance to play because the singles all lost and we came last in the competition.
To be honest, I was very mad at them because they promised that they could win. And I thought we could hold until the double. So we decided to put the best two players in the double. But none of them won. The whole competition ended for us.
To prepare for the competition next year, I set up a table tennis club in our division. I chose several students and trained them every week. I even joined the club of other divisions to see their players’ strengths and weaknesses. Based on the club members’ performance and other elements, I chose 4 girls and 4 boys for the competition.
I was expecting a hard competition because I saw many strong competitors in the other clubs. I told our team members to prepare themselves that they could not win the game easily. However, I was thinking something different: one of the leading player was already in his senior year; it was his last time attending the competition. I was also going to be a senior next year. So was the other leading player. The sophomores did not have anyone who could be the team leader yet. In other words, if we could not win this time, we may never be able to win again.
The competition was still in November, two months after school started. This time, four divisions attended the competition. So the competition would be a round robin for all the four divisions. Unexpectedly, we won the first two competitions quite easily. The two The night before the final competition, we were chatting online. I analyzed the situation for them: if we won the final game, we would definitely be the champion; if we lost the final game, there would still be a chance that we were the champion.
The final competition was in the noon break. I gathered all the other members in the club to

Is there a broader context that we should know about when comparing your qualifications (including grades and test scores) to other applicants? Examples include family responsibilities, English as a second language, health issues, or other personal circumstances. If so, explain.
If you are a sophomore, explain why are you applying this year rather than waiting until next year.
